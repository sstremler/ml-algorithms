# ml-algorithms

This repository consists of base machine learning algorithms and step-by-step visualizations, animations about their working. The algorithms are implemented in R or Python and they serve mainly educational purposes.

Algorithms implemented by now:
+ Perceptron
+ KernelPerceptron (in progress)
